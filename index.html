        <p>Multiple studies suggest that music is a source of productivity, however many teachers don’t believe this or simply don’t do their research. We are making a campaign to change this and ALLOW MUSIC TO BE PLAYED IN CLASS. We think that music will cause higher productivity and less talking (because teachers want us to stop talking). We need music to be allowed in many lessons such as HASS (history) and Religion (if your school has it).</p>

        <h2>Proof</h2>
        <p>Studies show that music causes productivity and makes you work more faster and efficiently. We need teachers to STOP the misinformation on this topic and many others. Just because we are not the same year level as when we first started listening to music doesn’t mean that we CAN’T listen to music and focus. IN MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION, music may even help lower stress and stop people from disrupting the class.</p>
